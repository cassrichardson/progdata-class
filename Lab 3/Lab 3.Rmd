```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```
## Exercise 24.2
```{r table}
print(gapminder)
```

```{r dplyr 1.1}
gapminder_three <- gapminder |> 
  filter((country == "Iceland" | country == "Italy" | country == "Switzerland") & year >= 1970, year < 1980)
```

```{r dplyr 1.2}
gapminder_three <- gapminder |> 
  filter((country == "Iceland" | country == "Italy" | country == "Switzerland") & year >= 1970, year < 1980) |>
  select(country, gdpPercap)
  print(gapminder_three)
```
```{r dplyr 1.3}
lifeExp_decrease <- gapminder |>
  group_by(country) |>
  mutate(lifeExp_decrease = lifeExp - lag(lifeExp)) |>
  filter(lifeExp_decrease < "0")
  print(lifeExp_decrease)
```
```{r}
print(gapminder)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
